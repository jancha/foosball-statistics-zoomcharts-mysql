MySQL + PHP + AgileData + ZoomCharts

To get started:

1) Create mysql database
2) Import data/db.sql
3) Copy config.php.dist to config.php and update to point to your db
4) php -q composer.phar install
5) Make sure the base of the folder is accesible via web server (e.g.
nginx/apache/etc)
6) Open index.html to see the working sample
